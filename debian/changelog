ros-noetic-robot-body-filter (1.1.7-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * When sensor frame is empty (autodetected), do not add it as initial monitored frame to watchdog.
  * Added configuration examples.
  * Make sure use_sim_time is set to false for tests.
  * Fixed computation of pointcloud without local bounding box.
  * Added tests for RobotBodyFilter.
  * No longer require the index pointcloud field in computeMask(), as it is not used anywhere.
  * Surprise! CropBox::setTransform() doesn't set transform of the cropbox, but instead a transform of the points. Fixed that.
  * Fixed copy-paste bug in bounding sphere publisher.
  * Fix incorrect usage of fixed frame at many places (substituted with filtering frame).
  * Make sure orientation.w = 1 is set in all published markers.
  * Correctly exclude the ignored bounding shapes from the published markers and shapes.
  * Make sure the published bounding shapes are computed as they appear at the time of the beginning of the scan.
  * Fix getShapeTransform() to correctly interpolate between before- and after-scan times. The logic was twisted, so with cacheLookupBetweenScansRation was zero, it returned the transform after scan.
  * Fix copy-paste bug in transform cache.
  * Make use of the newly optional scanFrame argument of computeMask()
  * Prevent division by zero in point-by-point scans with zero duration (which is weird, but well...)
  * Only compute sensor->filtering transform for all-at-once scans, because point-by-point scans have viewpoints instead.
  * Reworked how TFFramesWatchdog is initialized to allow easier reconfiguring of the filter.
  * Added RobotBodyFilter::failWithoutRobotDescription which aids in tests.
  * Clarified documentation of RobotBodyFilter regarding frames.
  * Add TFFramesWatchdog::isRunning().
  * Workaround PCL 1.8 ignoring CropBox::setKeepOrganized().
  * Added tests for filter utils.
  * Improved filter_utils documentation.
  * Improved getParamVerbose() with recursive resolution of slash-separated param names.
  * Make different performance test requirements for release and debug builds.
  * Added tests for RayCastingShapeMask and improved its documentation.
  * Added utility functions to compare transforms and generate random ones.
  * Implemented TF watchdog tests.
  * Prevented some more SIGABRTs from TFFramesWatchdog.
  * Added unit tests for utils.
  * Fixed a bug in OBB.contains(OBB) which compared against vertices of the wrong OBB.
  * Improved efficiency of Eigen expression by not using auto type.
  * Fix the reported transformation of default-constructed OBBs.
  * Fixed constructShapeFromBody() to correctly process meshes.
  * Fixed eigen and urdf includes.
  * Fixed printing of std containers in string_utils.
  * CREATE_FILTERED_CLOUD now prepends robot_body_filter stuff with a global namespace to be usable even from other namespaces.
  * Make sure sensor frame is monitored by the watchdog because we need to use it during the filtering. Fixes #6 <https://github.com/peci1/robot_body_filter/issues/6>.
  * Added parameter transforms/require_all_reachable.
  * Added to_string(bool) specialization.

  * Avoid subtracting from ROS time.
    This may lead to exceptions in simulation, where current time is 0. ros::Time cannot be negative.

ros-noetic-robot-body-filter (1.1.5-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * refactor(RobotBodyFilter): Made frames/sensor parameter optional (#2 <https://github.com/peci1/robot_body_filter/issues/2>)
    The sensor frame will now be derived from the incoming sensor messages.
    This way, messages from different sensors can be processed and the
    filter can be configured without any knowledge of the sensor.
  * Improved readme.
  * Reorganized the readme.
  * Added support for non-uniform scaling of collision meshes.

ros-noetic-robot-body-filter (1.1.0-1buster) buster; urgency=high

  * Increasing performance.
  * More descriptive frame configurations. Added the possibility to leave out clipping, contains or shadow tests.
  * Repurposed param ~transforms/timeout/reachable to be always used with remainingTime.
  * More efficient point transformation
  * Little improvements. Renamed the utils library to robot_body_filter_utils.
  * Removed compiler pragmas - they seem no longer needed.
  * Provided a fix for wrong box-ray intersections.
  * Fixed bodies.h header guard.
  * Fixed bug in cylinder shape creation.
  * Fixed a bug in constructMarkerFromBody() - references do not correctly support polymorphism.
  * Fixes for robot body filter. Added new bounding box types.
  * Fixed a few bugs while running under a nodelet.
  * Prepared remainingTime() to a situation where ROS time hasn't yet been initialized.
  * Added possibility to update only robot pose only with every n-th point in point_by_point scans.
    Added possibility to publish bounding sphere and box markers.
  * Renamed to robot_body_filter.
  * Reworked as a laser filter combining contains and shadow tests.
  * Make use of bodies.h and shapes.h from geometric_shapes.
  * Enabling generic point types, removed PCL dependency, removed unnecessary params.
  * Using all collision elements for each link instead of only the first one.
  * Testing all intersections instead of only the first one.
  * Merge branch 'master' into indigo-devel
  * Add robot_self_filter namespace before bodies and shapes namespace.
    geometric_shapes package also provides bodies and shapes namespace
    and same classes and functions. If a program is linked with
    geometric_shapes and robot_self_filter, it may cause strange behavior
    because of symbol confliction.
