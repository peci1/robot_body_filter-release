ros-melodic-robot-body-filter (1.1.6-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Avoid subtracting from ROS time.
    This may lead to exceptions in simulation, where current time is 0. ros::Time cannot be negative.

ros-melodic-robot-body-filter (1.1.5-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * refactor(RobotBodyFilter): Made frames/sensor parameter optional (#2 <https://github.com/peci1/robot_body_filter/issues/2>)
    The sensor frame will now be derived from the incoming sensor messages.
    This way, messages from different sensors can be processed and the
    filter can be configured without any knowledge of the sensor.
  * Improved readme.
  * Reorganized the readme.
  * Added support for non-uniform scaling of collision meshes.

ros-melodic-robot-body-filter (1.1.0-1stretch) stretch; urgency=high

  * Increasing performance.
  * More descriptive frame configurations. Added the possibility to leave out clipping, contains or shadow tests.
  * Repurposed param ~transforms/timeout/reachable to be always used with remainingTime.
  * More efficient point transformation
  * Little improvements. Renamed the utils library to robot_body_filter_utils.
  * Removed compiler pragmas - they seem no longer needed.
  * Provided a fix for wrong box-ray intersections.
  * Fixed bodies.h header guard.
  * Fixed bug in cylinder shape creation.
  * Fixed a bug in constructMarkerFromBody() - references do not correctly support polymorphism.
  * Fixes for robot body filter. Added new bounding box types.
  * Fixed a few bugs while running under a nodelet.
  * Prepared remainingTime() to a situation where ROS time hasn't yet been initialized.
  * Added possibility to update only robot pose only with every n-th point in point_by_point scans.
    Added possibility to publish bounding sphere and box markers.
  * Renamed to robot_body_filter.
  * Reworked as a laser filter combining contains and shadow tests.
  * Make use of bodies.h and shapes.h from geometric_shapes.
  * Enabling generic point types, removed PCL dependency, removed unnecessary params.
  * Using all collision elements for each link instead of only the first one.
  * Testing all intersections instead of only the first one.
  * Merge branch 'master' into indigo-devel
  * Add robot_self_filter namespace before bodies and shapes namespace.
    geometric_shapes package also provides bodies and shapes namespace
    and same classes and functions. If a program is linked with
    geometric_shapes and robot_self_filter, it may cause strange behavior
    because of symbol confliction.
