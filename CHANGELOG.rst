^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1.1.1 (2019-07-30)
------------------
* Fixed dependencies
* Contributors: Martin Pecka

1.1.0 (2019-07-18)
------------------
* Increasing performance.
* More descriptive frame configurations. Added the possibility to leave out clipping, contains or shadow tests.
* Repurposed param ~transforms/timeout/reachable to be always used with remainingTime.
* More efficient point transformation
* Little improvements. Renamed the utils library to robot_body_filter_utils.
* Removed compiler pragmas - they seem no longer needed.
* Provided a fix for wrong box-ray intersections.
* Fixed bodies.h header guard.
* Fixed bug in cylinder shape creation.
* Fixed a bug in constructMarkerFromBody() - references do not correctly support polymorphism.
* Fixes for robot body filter. Added new bounding box types.
* Fixed a few bugs while running under a nodelet.
* Prepared remainingTime() to a situation where ROS time hasn't yet been initialized.
* Added possibility to update only robot pose only with every n-th point in point_by_point scans.
  Added possibility to publish bounding sphere and box markers.
* Renamed to robot_body_filter.
* Reworked as a laser filter combining contains and shadow tests.
* Make use of bodies.h and shapes.h from geometric_shapes.
* Enabling generic point types, removed PCL dependency, removed unnecessary params.
* Using all collision elements for each link instead of only the first one.
* Testing all intersections instead of only the first one.
* Merge branch 'master' into indigo-devel
* Add robot_self_filter namespace before bodies and shapes namespace.
  geometric_shapes package also provides bodies and shapes namespace
  and same classes and functions. If a program is linked with
  geometric_shapes and robot_self_filter, it may cause strange behavior
  because of symbol confliction.

0.1.28 (2015-12-04)
-------------------
* Merge pull request `#8 <https://github.com/peci1/robot_body_filter/issues/8>`_ from wkentaro/indigo-devel-merge-master
  Merge master branch to indigo-devel
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into indigo-devel

* Merge pull request `#7 <https://github.com/peci1/robot_body_filter/issues/7>`_ from wkentaro/self_filter-timestamp
  Set correct timestamp for self filtered cloud
* Set correct timestamp for self filtered cloud
  This is needed because pcl drops some value of timestamp.
  So pcl::fromROSMsg and pcl::toROSMsg does not work to get correct timestamp.
